Michael says that "I had gone to the theatre with Paul at the time of the murder". Nathan says that "I was playing cards with Michael at the time of the murder". Omar says that "Nathan didn't commit the murder". Paul says that "Omar is not the murderer". Assuming the only one of the above statements is false and that one of them is the murderer, who is the murderer? </string>
